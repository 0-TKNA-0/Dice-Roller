This is a program that allows a user to simulate a dice roller, similar to what is used in some games of Dungeons & Dragons.
The user will enter the amount of dice they want to roll, followed by how many sides on each dice.
The dice will then be rolled and a summary of each dice will be showcased.
An additional feature is included which allows a dice to explode if it lands on the highest value that is possible.
If the dice lands on the highest value, then it will be re-rolled, adding the previous roll to the total.
